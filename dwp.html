          <h3>Universal Credit &ndash; terminal illness</h3>
          <p>
            I worked with a User Researcher and Content Designer to help improve
            a section of the Universal Credit registration process which dealt
            with a question around terminal illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current DWP policy deems anyone with
            <b>less than 6 months to live as being terminally ill</b> and is
            therefore fast tracked into a group that are paid at a higher rate
            and aren’t required to look for work.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a claimant selected that they have a terminal illness during
            registration they would then receive a <b>callback</b> to receive
            additional support.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >Almost all of these callbacks (to claimants) were not deemed to
              be terminally ill</b
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Firstly</b>, we needed to understand why so many claimants were
            incorrectly stating that they were terminally ill.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Secondly</b>, we wanted to improve the experience for people who
            had a terminal illness.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6">
          <h3>Insights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We spoke with internal subject matter experts and colleagues in
              Manchester who were tackling a similar issue with the health
              registration questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              It became clear that the DWP policy definition of
              <i>terminal illness (6 months or less)</i> was in stark contrast
              to the user’s understanding.
            </li>
            <li>
              People can have a terminal illness and still be expected to live
              beyond 6 months (for example: motor neurone disease).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="row col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6">
          <h3 class="h3-no-margin-top">Prototype V1</h3>
          <p>
            We decided to dig a bit deeper into the
            <i>terminal illness</i> comprehension and were able to meet with 5
            users at the PIP assessment centre in Canterbury and show them our
            initial prototype.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="images">
          <p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
            Prototype version 1
          </p>
          <img
            src="/images/prototype-v1.png"
            alt="Prototype version 1"
            class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3"
          />
        </div>

        <div class="row col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6">
          <p>
            As expected we found the majority of the users didn’t entirely
            understand what <i>terminal illness</i> is.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the users we spoke with had long term health conditions
            (asthma, diabetes etc) and some thought of these as terminal, and
            therefore indicated that they would select <i>terminal illness</i>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6">
          <h3>Prototype V2</h3>
          <p>
            For the 2nd iteration we removed the first screen and dropped the
            term <i>terminal illness</i> from the question. We introduced
            <i>less than 6 months to live</i> to match with the DWP terminal
            illness policy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="images">
          <p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
            Prototype version 2
          </p>
          <img
            src="/images/prototype-v2.png"
            alt="Prototype version 2"
            class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3"
          />
        </div>

        <div class="row col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6">
          <p>
            This more direct line of questioning worked better with users who
            had a long term illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            We added the callback screens and a line of text on the final screen
            which read,
            <i
              >your phone might show our number as blocked, or say ‘no caller
              ID’</i
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was to try to reduce the problem agents were having with
            claimants not answering their phones.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6">
          <h3>Final round</h3>
          <p>
            We took the prototype to the Maggie’s centre (cancer support) in
            Fulham where we sat down with some of their support staff to walk
            them through our research and prototype.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we gained further knowledge around the struggle that terminally
            ill patients (or their carer) tend to face when trying to claim
            benefits.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6">
          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            The redesigned journey was added to the Universal Credit
            registration flow and helped reduce the incorrect callback rate by
            <b>78%</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This saved the department a substantial amount of money whilst
            creating an improved experience for claimants.
