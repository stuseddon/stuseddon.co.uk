          <h3>MoJ &ndash; get help with child arrangements</h3>
          <p>
            I was involved in this project for a period of 4 months. During that
            time I worked closely with a content designer, user researcher and a
            team of developers. Together we worked to create a series of screens
            for the Ministry of Justice to help separating parents explore all
            their resolution options.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite legal aid being cut we were still seeing many parents (often
            self litagating) choosing the court route to resolve their dispute.
            The MoJ were seeing plenty of cases that needn’t have been in a
            court, but could’ve instead been resolved more effecively using a
            different method.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the course of several months we liaised with charities,
            educational bodies and other governmental departments. It was
            important that we understood the resolution options available for
            parents and children, along with the emotional toll that they could
            be subjected to throughout their journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our aim was to create a tool so parents could make a fair and
            informed decision as to which option was right for them.

        <p>
          From the first round of testing it became clear that parents liked
          bullet points which helped to quickly explain the key points of an
          option which had been previously unknown to them (for example:
          Mediation).
        </p>

        <p>
          Cost was also very important to the users, but some were confused with
          the symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside each summary was a ‘is this for you?’ box. The content of
          these boxes briefly picked out some pro’s and con’s for that
          particular resolution option.
        </p>

        <p>
          Parents found these useful, but they often missed them altogether.

          For the next round of testing we merged the bullet points with the ‘is
          this for you?’ box to create a single ‘pro’s and con’s’ piece of
          content. This tested very well.

        <h3>Refine our ideas</h3>
        <p>
          Based on what we’d learnt to date we began by identifying aspects of
          the tool that performed well in user research. We then brainstormed
          and explored high level concepts which could meet the refined user
          needs.

          Three concepts emerged during the ideation. They were Filter by theme,
          Shortlisting and Sentence builder.
        </p>
        <h3>Concept 1: filter by theme</h3>
        <p>
          Users have the ability to filter the content by things like 'Cost'
          'Legally binding', etc. and as well as filtering the options available
          content related to the filter would be highlighted or surfaced from
          the content pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users select the statements that they'd like to receive guidance on
          and the content in the guide updates.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="images">

          class="img-responsive col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1"
        />
      </div>

      <div class="row col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6">
        <h3>Concept 2: sentence builder</h3>
        <p>
          Users build a statement comprising of three parts (goal, what info and
          emotion) and the content in the guide updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal would help frame the content shown and could trigger relevant
          content. The info part (of which multiple could be selected) would
          trigger different sections of content.
        </p>
        <p>
          We imagined the emotions section would need more exploration, one idea
          was it could trigger different tones of voice (for example, worried
          and stressed might have a more reassuring tone).

        <h3>Concept 3: shortlisting</h3>
        <p>
          Users shortlisted subjects they were interested in contextually from
          the summary cards. This would create a 'reading list' of sorts
          containing all the subjects they’d picked.
        </p>

          These designs were guerrilla tested and ‘filter by theme’ was picked
          to be taken to a research lab for further testing with parents.
